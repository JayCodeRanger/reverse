# reverse
Reversing an integer and string made you easy by this snippet. Just import the file and then use these built-in functions in your program.

First import the reverse.py file

from reverse import *

Use reverseInt(arg) to reverse an integer value.

Use reverseStr(arg) to reverse a string value.

Thank You All...!
